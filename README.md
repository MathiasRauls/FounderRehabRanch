## Project Overview
This website is home to the non-profit, Founder Rehab Ranch, which started in 2005. FRR uses this site to collect donations, share recent news, and shoecase their beautiful horses.

This site was built using Python, HTML/CSS, Javascript, SQLite3 & Bootstrap in the Django framework.

## About FRR
Founder Rehab Ranch is a place where once neglected horses are truly cared for. All of our passionate volunteers help with feeding, washing, grooming, each and every horse. All of our horses have roughly 25 acres of land for them to actually roam free. Feel free to head to the site and have a look at what is happening at the ranch! 😊
