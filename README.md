## Project Overview
This website is home to the non-profit, Founder Rehab Ranch, which started in 2005. FRR uses this site to collect donations, share recent news, and shoecase their beautiful horses.

This site was built using Python, HTML/CSS, Javascript, Postgres SQL & Bootstrap in the Django framework.

## About FRR
In 2005, Beth Kennalley and Peggy Hetlage came together with a shared goal, founding the non-profit organization Founder Rehab Ranch (FRR). FRR is a safe haven for horses that were once neglected, offering them the opportunity to experience genuine care and attention.

Our dedicated volunteers play a vital role in the well-being of these horses, helping with daily tasks such as feeding, washing, and grooming. They work with care and enthusiasm, ensuring that the needs of each horse are met.

Currently, FRR is home to 17 horses, each with a distinct background. They are given the chance to thrive on around 10 acres of land, where they can roam and explore their surroundings freely.

At Founder Rehab Ranch, our mission is to provide a better life for these horses by creating an environment where they can heal and grow, all thanks to the support and commitment of our caring community.
